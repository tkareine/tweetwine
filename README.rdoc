= Tweetwine

A simple but tasty Twitter agent for command line use, made for fun.

== Installation

Install Tweetwine as a RubyGem from GitHub:

  $ sudo gem install tuomas-tweetwine --source http://gems.github.com

The program is compatible with Ruby 1.9.1.

== Usage

In the command line, run the program by entering

  $ tweetwine [-a username:password] [command]

The program needs the user's username and password for authentication. This
information can be supplied either as an option to the program or via a
configuration file. Without option <tt>[-a]</tt>, the program attempts to
read the configuration file for authentication.

The supported commands are

<tt>friends</tt>:: Fetch friends' latest statuses (the contents of the user's home).
<tt>user [name]</tt>:: Fetch a specific user's latest statuses, identified by the argument; if given no argument, fetch your own statuses.
<tt>update [status]</tt>:: Send a status update, but confirm the action first before actually sending. The status update can either be given as an argument or via STDIN if no argument is given.

If <tt>[command]</tt> is not given, it defaults to <tt>friends</tt>.

The configuration file, in <tt>~/.tweetwine</tt>, is in YAML syntax. It can
contain the following settings:

  username: <your_username>
  password: <your_password>
  colorize: true|false 

For all the options, see:

  $ tweetwine -h
